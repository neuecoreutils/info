# neuecoreutils

neueCoreutils is a suite of utilities written in Swift meant to feel and act like `bsdutils` and the GNU coreutils.

neueCoreutils aims to be POSIX-compliant with some modifications.

Each individual utility has its own Git repository as it is easier to work with them individually.
