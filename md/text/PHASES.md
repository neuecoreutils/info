There are four phases for this project:

**[1] Skeletal**
     
    Literally do one task it's supposed to do, not a lot of stuff.
    Largely un-orthodox when it comes to similarity with Unix components.


**[2] Muscular**

     Do a bit more than just one task.
     Similar to Unix componenents but not quite.


**[3] Musculoskeletal**
     
     Almost close to a proper coreutils system.
     Half-baked compatibility with Unix components.

**[4] Mechanical**

    Fully operable coreutils system.
    Full compatibility with Unix components.

Components: `all`
