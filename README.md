neueCoreutils is basically the [The GNU Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) written in Swift.

Fair warning, not **all** utilities are ported to Swift, and some of them are written in C, like `uname`.

The end goal **is** to have a fully functioning coreutils system completely written in Swift.

Also am a complete noob. So don't @me for the bad code.

Coded and tested on Fedora Workstation 35.

## Why?

I was bored.

## How do I install this?

By my gracious hands, every tarball that you download from [Releases] has a simple to use script to install neueCoreutils.

## How do I compile this?

Check the [build instructions page.](md/text/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## List of components and their "phases"

Check the [status page.](md/text/STATUS.md)
