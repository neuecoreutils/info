</p>


The sole purpose of this branch is to rewrite all the previous mistakes in neueCoreutils and reset the whole repository in general.

Some of the applications like `test` will temporarily have its development stopped.

## PROGRESS

`test` - removed
`date` - removed
`uname` - rewritten in Swift (cannot take multiple arguments)
`ls` - halted
`cp` - halted
`mv` - halted
`rm` - halted
`touch` - halted
`whoami` - theoretically complete
