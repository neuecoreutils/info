## What is neueCoreutils?

neueCoreutils is a faithful recreation of the UNIX utilities in the Swift programming language.

neueCoreutils aims to be POSIX-compliant.

## Why Swift?

I mainly chose to code in Swift for three reasons:
  * It is considerably easier than C
  * To give me a challenge while porting to Swift
  * To learn how certain utilities function

`ls` - halted
`cp` - halted
`mv` - halted
`rm` - halted
`touch` - halted
`whoami` - theoretically complete
